CRONY
=====

Crony is a template project to implement a cron like scheduler. [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) is used for scheduling and [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) is used for running the scheduler. This makes it perfect for a deployment on [heroku](http://heroku.com)'s [Caledon Cedar](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar) stack.


Usage
-----

Fork/clone this project, install the gems needed using bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

and start the scheduler using foreman:

```bash
bundle exec foreman start
```

Your crony won't do much yet (except for printing its heartbeat), so add some cron jobs now. And better delete that example job before you use it seriously.


Adding Cron Jobs
----------------

Each (non hidden) file in the `cron.d` directory will be evaluated and can be used to schedule jobs. Refer to [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler)'s documentation on how to schedule jobs. Be aware that your `cron.d` files will be evaluated in the context of the scheduler instance, so you can access all methods the scheduler has. Here's an example:

```ruby
every "5m" do
  # do something every five minutes
end
```

You can have as many jobs as you wish within one file. Separating them in several files is just a way to organize and group your jobs for better overview.

Within your `cron.d` files, you can do anything: Requiring other files/gems (remember to put them into your `Gemfile` first), defining classes/methods etc. This way, you can do anything from sending emails to pinging other sites of yours (eg using the fabulous [httpi](https://github.com/rubiii/httpi)) to start a task there or to keep them alive when the hoster shuts them down after a certain time of inactivity.


Heroku Deployment
-----------------

After you've added your jobs and helpers, you're ready to deploy your jobs to heroku:

```bash
# create an application on the Caledon Cedar stack
heroku create --stack cedar

# tell heroku not to install the gems you only need for your local development/testing
heroku config:add BUNDLE_WITHOUT=development

# deploy your code
git push heroku master

# scale your worker (one is well within heroku's limits for a free app)
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

After this, your private crony instance will happily be running and executing your jobs.

If you want to pause the scheduler, just scale your worker down to 0:

```bash
heroku ps:scale worker=0
```

To restart, scale it back up to 1 again.

Be aware that heroku cycles your processes every 24h meaning that your crony instance will be restarted once daily. There shouldn't be any problems, though - unless this collides exactly with a job you've scheduled.


Future Ideas
------------

* Implement database backed (instead of file based) job configuration that would allow for management of jobs via the command line (eg rake tasks) without the need to redeploy the app.
* Integrate a web view - currently, accessing the URL of your app will result in an error since the only process won't serve HTTP requests.


Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute changes you've made, helper scripts or anything else, please fork this project and send a pull request with your changes.

Preferably, you keep the master branch in your fork clean and create another branch to add your own jobs and push that to heroku. This way, you can keep the master branch clean from personal files and make those pull requests easier for both of us. Just rebase your personal branch on top of master and use `-f` when pushing to heroku.
